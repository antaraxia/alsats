# alsats - active learning for a few satoshis.
Label data intelligently using Active Learning. Pay in (mili)sats only for the compute you consume.

alsats reduces the time and cost required to create minimum viable datasets in supervised learning problems.
It has the following features:
* API based model training and data labeling.
* Intelligent labeling - Label training examples based on model uncertainty predictions for said examples.
* Iterative Learning - Learn models starting with as little as one data point. As more data is labeled and trained, model metrics and labeling suggestions improve.
* Flexible payments - Pay ONLY for the compute consumed in the process (i.e. pay for as little as one milisat per training/label iteration).
* Train and label trustlessly - No need to register/sign-up for an account. 
* Data security - alsats doesn't store any user data in it's current implementation. Future implementations will store data only if the customer wants it to.
